# Automated-Assessment-System Prototype


1)Background：

Due to the significant increase in university class sizes, leading to prolonged assessment turnaround times. However those virtual learning environments that provide facilities for online tests are expensive.
Recognising the importance of both formative and summative assessment, there's a demand for an easy-to-use, flexible, and cost-effective tool to automate assessments while providing timely feedback to students.

2)Problem Statement：

Build an easy-to-use Automated Assessment Tool (AAT) prototype, enabling teaching-staff provide formative and summative assessments for university students.


3)Tools Used:

Python Flask is used for the web interface.

Waterfall Methodology is used for the team to work with a joint contribution. 

During the developing stage, weekly tasks was planned out by drawing a Gantt Chart and using the branch function on Gitlab to develop and merge each function together.

4)Functions Implemented:

The AAT prototype allow teaching-staff able to Add, Edit and Delete questions.

Teaching staff can add, edit and delete assessments of summative and formative types.

Student users are able to undertake assessments of summative type (assessment of learning), receiving automatically generated feedback at a point defined by the teaching-staff from each question.

Teaching-staff are able to review relevant student-user attainment, attempt and engagement statistics. 

Students are able to review relevant attempt, attainment and engagement statistics.

Students are able to indicate satisfaction with the AAT, questions, assessments and other relevant factors.

Teaching-staff are able to review relevant student satisfaction statistics informing teaching and assessment in-or-out of the AAT.

Both teaching-staff and students are able to leave and review comments on questions set as part of a formative assessment.

Relevant gamification features (badges/medals, profiles, profile-upgrades, leader-boards) for achievements attained by students are included and viewable by other student and teaching-staff users.
